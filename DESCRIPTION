Description: This package is designed to help the teaching of Loess
    regression. The primary function, loess_vis, creates a ggplot2 image
    whereby the points are shaded based upon their weight when estimating
    y at a given x value. The accompanying Shiny application utilizes this
    function by allowing the user to modify the parameters of the
    loess_vis function.
